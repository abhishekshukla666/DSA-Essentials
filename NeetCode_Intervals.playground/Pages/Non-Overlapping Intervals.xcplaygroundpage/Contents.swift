/*
 Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
 Example 2:

 Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
 Output: 2
 Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 Example 3:

 Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
 Output: 0
 
 Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
